# cheatsheets and functionns
Ironhack cheatsheets und functions - Christoph Ameseder

- in this repository I put some of my functions and a cheatsheet I did after 3 days @ Ironhack, in a Jupyter notebook (do not run it - it is only for reference and copy/paste

- further there are cheatsheets for Numpy, SciKit-Learn in pdf format which is recommendeded as further ressources in the learning platform from Ironhack

-I added as well a Jupyter notebook template, as I struggeled the last 2 days with my workflow. My idey is to fork and clone all necessary repositories from the learning plattform every morning before the course for each and every activity and and lab. Copying and renaming the template in the sepcific folder and already run the pd.read_csv hopefully safes some time during lecture to finish the tasks in time

Feel free to frok it and use it... hopefully it helps
